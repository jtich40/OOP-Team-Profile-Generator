# Team Profile Generator
  ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-red.svg)

## Description
This application grants the user the ability to create a personalized HTML webpage featuring their software development team profiles. Once the user inputs "node index.js" in their terminal, a series of prompts powered by the inquirer package will appear. After the user has filled out all information for their team members and exits the application, their Team Profile HTML webpage will be generated.
